# SCOUT

This model is pretrained from 'slowpoke', using Meetup-2 model trained in DR console,
and rewareded to follow the centerline and go very slowly.

The purpose of this model is to:
	1. capture dependable images of a new track from local training
	2. capture detailed logs in virtual circuit tracks which we don't have access to
