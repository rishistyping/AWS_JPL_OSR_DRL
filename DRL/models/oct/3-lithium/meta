description: Lithium is for  training the October Canada_Training track with a
	reward based on the race line and heading.
target: OCT

lessons:
- session1: After running for a good few hours the completion rate was very low, around
	40% averate.  I can see in evauation runs that the car like to drive straight
	off the track.  I suspect there may be a few problems, possibly the action
	space has speeds way too high, or that the model is "seeing" something where
	it believes it is on a different part of the track and it should be going
	straight (e.g. tree). 
	I'll have to abandon this generation and improve (a) more conservative
	action space, and (b) some conclusive analysis using images and tensorflow
	which would prove that the car has incentive to drive straight.
