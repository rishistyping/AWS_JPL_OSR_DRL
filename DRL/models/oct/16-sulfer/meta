title: Sulfer (S)
description: Sulfer is a simple basis of progress-based rewards along
	the race line, itself significantly different from the center line.
	We'll add rewards shaping in later sessions
target: training experiments only
lessons:
- session1: Decent progress after 5 hours training with ~2% completion rate
- session2: Add wheel factor shaping reward in order to speed up learning
	by not relying only on one single episode end step in order to
	learn about edges of the track
