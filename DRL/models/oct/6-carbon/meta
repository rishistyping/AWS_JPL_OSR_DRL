title: Carbon (C)
description: Carbon builds on the knowledge gained from Boron, where the 
	minimal action space was too small to navigate all of the track
	successfully. 
	We also learned the limits of speed vs steering angle.
	We also had successful focused training on the serpentine track
	by disabling round robin restarts
target: OCT
lessons:
- session1: Tried new action space, encouraged by results up front where
	the completion rate was growing, even a few complete laps.
	Stopped the training before it converged too much since the car
	had been not succesfully navigated a few tough areas.
- session2: Lower learning rate and entropy in order to get the car to gain 
	more experience near the ideal solution and not be so erratic.
	Stopped again after much improvement but noticing that the car
	specifically can't navigate the serpentine well.  
- session3: Changed the reward to promote race line position (vs just heading) 
	and disabled round-robin starts. Also added wheel factor to
	rewards in order to penalize hitting the barrier, which I suspect
	is causing wipeouts at high speed on the final turn.
	There were a handful of nicely executed episodes but no complete
	laps and probably due to the high speed hitting track edges
	or nebulous rewards at certain parts of the track.
- session4: focused training on start position.  Lower minibatch size
	and learning rate to ease convergence and allow time for full
	laps to happen
