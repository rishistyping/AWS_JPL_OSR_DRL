title: Neon (Ne)
description: Neon is aimed at testing sparse rewards based on progress
	and steps taken (i.e. time)
	by training on the straight track at full throttle.
	Checkpoints are evenly spaced every 10 progress
lessons:
- session1: 3-6-9 speeds
- session2: lower learning rate, increase batch size to 128
- session3: lower beta entropy, increase batch size to 256
- session4: increase batch size to 512
- session5: lower learning rate, increase iteration episodes, lower epochs (NaN crash)
	- session6: lower learning rate, increase iteration episodes
	- session6a: top speed to 12, start round-robin
- session5a: top speed to 11, increase iteration episode
	session5a-tune1: 6@20->7@17, 3@35->3@30 Currently Oct standing at 40th place 9.650
	session5a-tune2: 7@17=>7@20, 11@0->11.5@0

- session5b: stay with action space that is working (3/6/9) and tune it up to
	use full throttle in more places.  Also fix a few checkpoints which
	caused bad incentives to crash
