title: beryllium (Be)
description: Beryllium is to abandon novel or experimental strategies and try to
	aim for simplicity, allowing us a good leaderboard position which we
	can incrementally improve upon
target: OCT

lessons:
- session1: small action space, flat speeds at what should be the proper turn
	angles for this track (25deg worked well on previous generations)
	GREAT placement from this model, where we leveraged the models choice
	of actions at even pace (speed 4) and afterwards tuned them up to greater
	speeds.
- session2a: continue training just beause i've had so little success with
	other models
