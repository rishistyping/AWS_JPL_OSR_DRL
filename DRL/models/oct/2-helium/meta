title: helium
description: Helium is a test model for trying out a "braking speed", where we introduce
	a very low throttle to be used in anticipation of cornering.  This is to give
	the car some time to decelerate before turning and hopefully avoid wipeouts.
target: This is just a test for the theory, to be applied if successful

lessons:
- session1: simple speed-based reward converged completely at about 6 hours training, though
	lap completion rate is very low.  A lower learning rate may have helped get the
	car through the twisty section just by having more samples there.  Also some
	focused training on that leg of the track could also help.
