title: Sodium (Na)
description: Sodium is building on the success of Neon, using the same
	sparse rewards strategy, but tuning the placement of checkpoints
	after observing some unwanted "hunting" of the nearest skew of
	the checkpoint.
target: October virtual circuit race
lessons:
- session1: Good progress, though GPU crashed
- session2: Good progress again, stopped just to tune hyperparameters
- session3: Hyperparameter tuning: learning rate, batch size, entropy.
	Lots of environmental hacks:
		- mask top of images to tune out the buildings
		- replace water textures to suppress ground features
		- back up start position to 96%, closer to evaluation start
- session3b: turn on round-robin: total failure, but could be due to too high of speeds
- session3c: turn off round-robin again, make top speed 11 and 6@20->7@20 to ease the spin-outs
	- session3c2: try to continue, but with modified second checkpoint; didn't progress
- session3d: back up again
	this guy is too weighted to turn at the exit of corner 1
