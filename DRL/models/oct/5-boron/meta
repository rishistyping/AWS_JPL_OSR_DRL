title: boron (B)
description: Boron is an experiment to continue down the 'simplicity' path,
	where we had success with good lap times using a 5-action model and
	tuning cycles after training (modifying action space without retraining).
target: OCT
lessons:
- session1: Very happy with success and pace of session1.  Driving was pretty
	erratic but still able to tune the car up from ~14s to ~11s pace
- session2: Retrain with new tuned action spaces, 3-30 left speed-steer and
	8-15 right handers, values taken from session1 tuning
- session3: Focused training session on the serpentine where we need to
	train the can to drive straight through.  Use fixed start position
	for all episodes and the race line in reward function.  Should take
	two hours or so to teach him to navigate that properly.
- session5a: turn off environment features in the sdf file
