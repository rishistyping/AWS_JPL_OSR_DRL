model: Nero
description:
	Nero is a simple test of sim2real by trying to get a car running at all in my
	apartement wood floor test track.  Later training will focuse on generalization
	but this will try to just replicate the lack of contrast between the roadway
	and lane markers which exist in reality and in reinvent_wood virtual track.
