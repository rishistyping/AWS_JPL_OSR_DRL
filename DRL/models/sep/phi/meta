title: phi
description: Phi is for testing out race-line headings as primary influence.  The
	action space is constrained since that yielded quick convergence in other
	tests.
target: If phi does well with heading tracking, we will hope to use it as SEP submission.

lessons:
- session1: Mexico track, race-line heading tracking, slower speed (3) to get completion rates reasonably high
	GREAT convergence, Great track completion rate, but not a great time due to slow speeds.  Looks also as
	if the heading incentive is also telling the car to crash into the walls.
- session2: higher speed
	Good convergence for the first few iterations, then started losing speed and stability.  I can
	see from the heatmap that the car is not following the race line as much as it could be
- session3: add proximity to race line for the reward
	While I don't see improvement on times, I do see in the heatmap that the car is staying closer to the
	race line.  It may be that the difference in track position didn't have as much tangible effect
	on track times as it could, or that learning rates are just too high for the subtle difference in
	reward. It was not bad so i will try again with higher speeds and lower learning rate
- session4: biggest change will be action space so we'll introduce that now before tweaking hyperparameters; trying
	a shift in steering angle since the model leans HEAVILY on left-30deg beyond other actions.  Shifted
	steering angles 5deg left for all actions in order to see how far the car will use them.
	Shift in steering caused more balance between the left-most and second-left-most actions, while the
	training and completion metrics all seem flat.  Will continue tuning other parameters
- session5: higher speeds (5) and lower learning rate (0.00003). Modified together to see if we can advance our training
	results quickly due to running out of SEP time.
	Convergence was helped GREATLY by lower learning rate but only improved evaluation results for the first 7
	iterations before completion rate and pace started to get worse.
- session6: adjust reward structure for race-line-factor to be 0.75 up from 0.5. Run for 5 hours had GREAT convergence,
	but possibly too much as entropy is way down and the car might not like introducing differing speeds:$
- session7: higher speed
- session7a: retry of higher speed, but lower entropy and learning rate hyperparameters
	This had a hard time converging, and as well had a very low completion rate.  Trying again with minor
	hyperparameters adjustments
- session7b: try higher speed again, this time giving sharpest turn a lower speed and bumping the favorite action
	to 0.5 higher.  Also increase learning rate to hopefully converge better while keeping entropy low to
	keep the race line
	EXCELLENT convergence, even some 100% completion times, though evaluation did not fare well as model
	could not complete the track.  Training went for ~4 hours which was still converging
- session8: Continue session7b, but stop round robin starts and only do starts from waypoint zero.  Hopefully
	this will allow us to stabilize the race-line along the harder curves where starting position of mid-track
	is not something that will happen during evaluations
	Fair convergence, good improvement on start of track but seems that the progress dies off in later steps
	which may be due to entropy and loss_type hyperparameters trying to inject randomness in later steps.
- session8a: Same as session8 except to swap loss_type for MSE and lower entropy to encourange the model to
	stay more stable and reach further into the track
- session8b:
- session9: Faster speeds all across
	Bad convergence
- session9b:
- session9c: Too fast/sharp on turns meant always wiping out on turn 1
- session9d: Turn down sharp turns to avoid skids, leaving narrow angles at higher speeds
- session9e: Some convergence (hyperparams were good) though the model kept crashing between 20-40 percent
	progress, too unstable to make it through evaluations.  Adjusted tight turns to be slower and give
	the car some room to navigate turns easily
- session9f: found and fixed a bug in the race line heading calculation, specifically around +/-180
	Convergence was good for the hour it ran but I wonder if the change_starting_position is causing
	too little training for later legs.  Will continue this model training with other settings
- session10: Turn down entropy all the way (variance in car handling is enough entropy) and turn on
	round-robin starts to hopefully get a little more resilience in the model, hoping to raise
	completion rates
	Good convergence but very slow in evaluations, i'm chalking it up to round robin starts
- session10a: Turning round-robin starts back off while turning entropy down all the way to zero.
- session9g:
